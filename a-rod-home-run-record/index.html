<p>On October 4 2009 during the final game of the season Rodriguez hit two home runs in the sixth inning that drove in seven runs setting an American League record for most RBI by a batter in a single inning and giving him his 12th consecutive season 13 overall of reaching 30 home runs and 100 RBIs breaking a tie with Manny Ramirez Babe Ruth and Jimmie Foxx for the most in MLB history. Barry Bonds broke Williams unbreakable on-base. I think that Rodriguez will break the record and if he does at least he will earn it. If he does hes eligible for a 6 million. Another controversial figure on this list A-Rod enjoyed an incredible mid-career run in which he averaged 46 home runs during a nine-year period from 1999-2007.

<p>But you also have to look at Sammy Sosa because in 2007 he hit that unbelievable 600 home run but if you really look at him you know that he is getting old and Rodriguez is only in his 30s so yes A-Rod. A-Rods new contract would include incentives for home run record. Rodriguez did hit 33 home runs in 2015 after sitting. Alex Rodriguez hits the 600th home run of his career a two-run blast to center field in the first inning. If he does hes eligible for a 6 million.
