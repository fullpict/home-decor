<p>As work starts on our development of 16 Active Homes in Neath we talked to some Pobl colleagues as well as partners from Specific and Neath Port Talbot Coun. The Active Homes Neath project is a partnership between housing organisation Pobl Group Neath Port Talbot Borough Council and Swansea Universitys SPECIFIC Innovation Knowledge Centre. The report is based on designs for the Active Homes Neath social housing development which was granted planning permission today is currently in planning.</p>
<h3 id="the-active-homes">The Active Homes.</h3><p>The Active Buildings concept developed by SPECIFIC includes integrated photovoltaic panels on the roofs and a solar heat collector on south-facing walls for water heating. Active Homes Residential This development of 16 residential units for Pobl Group and working in partnership with SPECIFIC Innovation and Knowledge Centre based at Swansea University is designed to be an exemplar low cost energy positive scheme. Active Homes Neath will consist of 16 new build homes and we wanted an informative and interactive presentation that allowed users to experience and learn about the combination of innovative technologies that will allow the homes to generate store and release their own energy. The project in Neath is the first development of social housing to use these renewable technologies in the UK. The project has generated great interest from a number. That would be a huge saving for anybody but it is particularly significant in Wales where 23 of households are in fuel poverty spending 10 or more of their total income on energy costs.</p>
