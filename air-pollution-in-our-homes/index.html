<p>Toxic gases like Nitrogen dioxide NOx Sulphur dioxide SO2 Carbon monoxide CO Ozone O3 etc. Cooking and heating with polluting fuels and technologies produces high levels of household air pollution which includes a range of health damaging pollutants such as fine particles and carbon monoxide. Because we spend roughly 90 percent of our time indoors and as much as 70 percent of that time is indoors in our homes it is important that we pay closer attention to.</p>

What causes indoor air pollution. In fact recent research by the Environmental Protection Agency estimates the air in our homes can be up to five times more polluted than in big cities. We associate pollution with mainly metropolitan areas but its just as much of a concern indoors. In Gibraltar however this is not necessarily the case due to our proximity to the refinery industries across the Bay as well as the ship repair yard and proximity of ships bunkering. Dirt dust mould chemicals even plasticspolystyrene and electronics all contribute to the toxins in our air.</p>
