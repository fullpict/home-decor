<p>Went to collect a credit card at the Sandton ABSA branch when I got there it was PACKED. This makes it possible for people to realize their rights and access benefits and opportunities in both the public and private domains. Though Absa has a dedicated line between its backend systems and home affairs it can only access ID and fingerprint information and does not have access to additional information like criminal records. This makes it possible for people to realize their rights and access benefits and opportunities in both the public and private domains. Reandani was nothing short of amazing.
