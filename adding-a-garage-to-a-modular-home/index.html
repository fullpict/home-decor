<p>The speed of modular construction is a tremendous benefit when building a modular second-story addition plan since the addition can be set in place within hours after the roof is removed from your existing home. If adding a built-in garage expect the costs to be that of an attached garage with living space above 60000 to 65000 plus the added expense of creating an access point from the garage to the house and from the house to living space above the garage which will add at least another 1000. Adding a garage to a manufactured home is possible. To connect the additions roof to the home if the addition is lower than the roof on your home you will need to use flashing to seal the gap between the home and the addition. If you are deciding whether to add a garage option to your home the best time to make the decision is prior to the selection and purchase of your home so that the garage can be added to the design of your manufactured or modular home before it.
