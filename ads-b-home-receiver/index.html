<p>ADS-B means Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast aircraft transmit in-flight data such as identification position and speed. Stratux-based ADS-B receivers are the only full-featured receivers on the market that are compatible with every major EFB. Enhance your inflight situational awareness with dual-band ADS-B weather and traffic and other advanced capabilities in a portable package. Due to some experimental work in other features such as EKF2 available RAM may be limited. Stratux is free software that enables DIY and low cost ADS-B receivers for pilots.

<p>Conversely an aircraft can be fitted with an ADS-B receiver processor to display the detected ADS-B transmissions from other aircraft to the pilot. ADS-B improves safety and efficiency in the air and on runways reduces costs and lessens harmful effects on the environment. The whole project costs around 160 at the time of this video. Over on Imgur and Reddit user Mavericknos has uploaded a very nice pictorial guide where he shows how hes built a high performance RTL-SDR based ADS-B receiver that can be mounted outside in a waterproof enclosure. We were the first company to successfuly demonstrate 978 MHz ADS-B on the Asian 2005 and African 2006 continents and our record of the successful design and construction of numerous ADS-B ground stations and the installation of ADS-B avionics systems in hundreds of aircraft marks us as one of the most experienced ADS-B system integrators in the World today.
