<p>Continence care products when bought by organizations or companies have to include VAT. Where those expense costs are directly linked to the provision of goods or services that are subject to VAT supplies charged at 0 5 or 20 then the answer will usually be yes. Home care bosses have called for social care provision to be zero-rated for VAT so that they can reclaim VAT on business expenses to support the sector during the COVID-19 pandemic. This leaves some agencies in a position where they must pay VAT to their suppliers where the concession does not apply but dont charge it to their clients where it does. However where nursing staff are supplied the end-user quite reasonably does not expect to pay VAT because the supply of nurses by agencies is exempt under the Nursing Agencies Concession.

<p>My question is what is agencys gross sales when it comes to meeting requirement. If the home wasnt registered under a toothbrush scheme during this period it is therefore possible for it to register for VAT between 1993 and IIRC 20th March 2002 the 1993 date is when residential care responsibilities fell on Local Authorities rather than one of the central govt. Services which are exempt from the VAT Act include. A nursing agency currently qualifies for the nursing agencies concession from VAT afforded by Revenue Customs Brief 1210 ie. Minding of children in private or municipal pre-schools care services in nursing homes and home help services.
