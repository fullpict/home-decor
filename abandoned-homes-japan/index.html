<p>Japan is riddled with millions of vacant homes called akiya that local governments hope will sell for next-to-nothing along with cash incentives to encourage buyers. In Japanese ç©º ã ã å®¶ ã akiya are houses that are abandoned or unoccupied. You can find abandoned houses all over Japan due to the countrys shrinking population. Akiya financing is very possible though there are details to pay attention to and processes to conduct correctly. The type and condition of these houses varies drastically depending on each property.
