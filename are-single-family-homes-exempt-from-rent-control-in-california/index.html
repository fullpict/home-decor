<p>San Francisco renters living in single-family homes and condominiums are not covered by the price control portion of rent control. Do I need to register it with the Rent Board. Most single-family homes are exempt regardless of when they were built. The just cause limitations of the Protection Act apply to fully rented non-owner occupied duplexes and houses run as boarding houses or dormitories. So single-family homes are exempt unless the property is owned by a real estate investment trust REIT a corporation or a limited liability company where one of the members is a corporation.

AB 1482 covers buildings that are 15 years old or older but does not include single-family homes. Californians Here S Why Your Housing Costs Are So High Calmatters.</p>
