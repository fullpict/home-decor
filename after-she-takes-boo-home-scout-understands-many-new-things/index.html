<p>When hes ready to leave Scout leads him to the porch. To Kill a Mockingbird. What are some themes in this novel.</p>
<h3 id="scout-knows-she-cant-be-seen-leading-him-so-she-asks-him-to-bend-his-arm-so-it-looks-like-hes-escorting-her">Scout knows she cant be seen leading him so she asks him to bend his arm so it looks like hes escorting her.</h3><p>Answer 1 of 2. Explain some of the things she now understands about Boos perspective. After she takes Boo home Scout understands many new things because she is able to see the street from his point of view. Scout takes Boos hand leads him to Jems bed and encourages him to stroke Jems hair. I would argue that Scout comes to realize two important things while standing on the Radleys porch at the end of the novel having escorted Boo home. She takes Boo home and realising he will always be a damaged person knows that she will never see him again.</p>
