<p>Aluminum wiring was used in homes and mobile homes from the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s. Aluminum provides a better conductivity to weight ratio than copper and therefore is also used for wiring power grids including overhead power transmission lines and local power distribution lines as well as for power wiring of some airplanes. After a decade of use by homeowners and electricians inherent weaknesses were discovered in the metal that lead to its disuse as a branch wiring material. A report by the Consumer Product Safety Commission CPSC indicates that homes with aluminum wiring are 55 times more likely to have fire hazard conditions than those with copper wiring. Aluminum tends to oxidize when exposed to air resulting in overheating and eventually failure at the termination points.
